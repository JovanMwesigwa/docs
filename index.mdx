## Welcome to FundKit

FundKit is a **universal payment SDK** that gives developers one unified API across all major mobile money and card providers in Africa.

Instead of waiting weeks for provider approvals, your team can start building **immediately** in FundKit’s sandbox environment. By the time your compliance team is done with paperwork, your app is already tested, integrated, and ready for production — just swap in live keys, no code changes required.

## Why FundKit?

Integrating mobile money and card providers is painful:

- Every provider has its own APIs, authentication, and quirks
- You can't properly test until your compliance paperwork is approved
- Developers get blocked while compliance teams work
- Switching providers often means rewriting your entire integration
